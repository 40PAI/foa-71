## ðŸš€ Tech Stack Overview

*   **Frontend Framework**: React (with TypeScript)
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI)
*   **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state, React Context for global UI state
*   **Routing**: React Router DOM
*   **Icons**: Lucide React
*   **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
*   **Charting**: Recharts

## ðŸ“š Library Usage Guidelines

To maintain a consistent and efficient codebase, please adhere to the following rules when using libraries:

*   **UI Components (Shadcn/ui)**:
    *   **Always** prioritize `shadcn/ui` components for all UI elements (buttons, cards, forms, tables, dialogs, etc.).
    *   If a specific `shadcn/ui` component does not exist or doesn't meet the exact requirements, **do not modify the `shadcn/ui` component files directly**. Instead, create a new component in `src/components/` that wraps or extends the `shadcn/ui` component, or build a new component from scratch using Tailwind CSS.
    *   Ensure all `shadcn/ui` components are imported from `@/components/ui`.

*   **State Management (React Query)**:
    *   **Always** use `React Query` for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state.
    *   Define custom hooks for data fetching (e.g., `useProjects`, `useTasks`) in the `src/hooks/` directory.
    *   For global UI state that doesn't involve server interaction (e.g., theme, sidebar open/close), use `React Context` from `src/contexts/`.

*   **Styling (Tailwind CSS)**:
    *   **Exclusively** use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling. Avoid custom CSS files or inline styles unless absolutely necessary for dynamic, complex calculations.
    *   Leverage responsive design utilities provided by Tailwind (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
    *   Utilize the defined design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) from `index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.

*   **Icons (Lucide React)**:
    *   **Always** use icons from the `lucide-react` library. Import them directly as named exports.

*   **Forms (React Hook Form & Zod)**:
    *   **Always** use `react-hook-form` for form management.
    *   **Always** use `Zod` for schema validation with `react-hook-form` resolvers.

*   **Charting (Recharts)**:
    *   **Always** use `Recharts` for data visualization components.
    *   Ensure charts are responsive and integrate with the application's theme.

*   **Date Management (date-fns)**:
    *   **Always** use `date-fns` for all date manipulation and formatting tasks.

*   **Routing (React Router DOM)**:
    *   **Always** use `react-router-dom` for navigation and routing within the application. Keep routes defined in `src/App.tsx`.

*   **Notifications (Sonner)**:
    *   **Always** use `sonner` for toast notifications to provide user feedback. The `useSonnerToast` hook is available for consistent usage.

*   **File Uploads**:
    *   **Always** use the `FileUpload` component from `src/components/ui/file-upload.tsx` for handling file uploads to Supabase Storage.

*   **Currency Inputs**:
    *   **Always** use the `CurrencyInput` component from `src/components/ui/currency-input.tsx` for currency input fields.

By following these rules, we ensure a cohesive, high-quality application that is easy to develop and maintain.
